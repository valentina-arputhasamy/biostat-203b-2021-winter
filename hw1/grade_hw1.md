### Overall Grade: 90/100

### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? 

-   Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (R markdown) for better reproducibility?

-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report? 

### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 51/50

### Usage of Git: 9/10

-   Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?

-   Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 
          
-   Is the hw1 submission tagged? 

-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 
  
-   Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. You included a .tex and .log file in your commit. 

### Reproducibility: 10/10

-   Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? Just click the `knit` button will produce the final `html` on teaching server? 

-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?
