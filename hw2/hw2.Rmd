Use tidyverse (ggpot2, dplyr) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic-iv.mit.edu) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat203b-2021winter.github.io/hw/hw1/hw1.html).

## Q1. PhysioNet credential

At this moment, you should already get credentialed on the PhysioNet. Please include a screenshot of your `Data Use Agreement for the MIMIC-IV (v0.4)`.

*Solution:*

![PhysioNet Credential](biostat-203b-2021-winter/hw2/PhysioNet Credential.png)

## Q2. `read.csv` (base R) vs `read_csv` (tidyverse) vs `fread` (data.table)

There are quite a few utilities in R for reading data files. Let us test the speed of reading a moderate sized compressed csv file, `admissions.csv.gz`, by three programs: `read.csv` in base R, `read_csv` in tidyverse, and `fread` in the popular data.table package. Is there any speed difference?

In this homework, we stick to the tidyverse. 

*Solution:*

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
getwd()
setwd("/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv/core")

read.csv("admissions.csv.gz") #took about 45 seconds
read_csv("admissions.csv.gz") #took 7 seconds
fread("admissions.csv.gz") #took about 4 seconds
```

After testing all three options, I found that `fread` read the file the quickest; it took about 4 seconds to read the file. The second quickest was `read_csv`, and took about 7 seconds. The slowest option was `read.csv`, which took 45 seconds to read the file (making it the slowest by quite a bit).

## Q3. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. Summarize following variables using appropriate numerics or graphs:   

- how many unique `stay_id`?  

There are 69,619 unique values for `stay_id`.

```{r}
setwd("/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv/icu")
icustays <- read_csv("icustays.csv.gz")
length(unique(icustays$stay_id))
```

- how many unique `subject_id`?  

There are 50,048 unique values for `subject_id`.

```{r}
length(unique(icustays$subject_id))
```

- length of ICU stay

```{r}
icustays$intime <- ymd_hms(icustays$intime)

icustays$outtime <- ymd_hms(icustays$outtime)

icustays$stayduration <- log(as.double(difftime(icustays$outtime, icustays$intime, units = "days")))
```

```{r}
icustays %>% ggplot(aes(stayduration)) + geom_histogram(fill = "thistle4") + theme_minimal() + ggtitle("ICU Stay Duration") + xlab("Length of ICU Stay \n (Log-Transformed)") + ylab("count")
```

- first ICU unit  

```{r}
icustays2 <- icustays 
icustays2 <- icustays2 %>% mutate(first_careunit_recode = recode(first_careunit, "Coronary Care Unit (CCU)" = "CCU", "Trauma SICU (TSICU)" = "TSICU", "Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU)" = "MICU/SICU", "Medical/Surgical Intensive Care Unit (MICU/SICU)" = "MICU/SICU", "Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU)" = "MICU/SICU", "Cardiac Vascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU)" = "CIVICU", "Neuro Surgical Intensive Care Unit (Neuro SICU)" = "Neuro SICU"))

icustays2 %>% ggplot( aes(first_careunit_recode))+ geom_bar(fill = "thistle4") + scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=3)) + theme_minimal() + ggtitle("Number of Patients by First ICU Type") + xlab("ICU Type") + ylab("count")
```


- last ICU unit  

## Q4. `admission` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `ADMISSION.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. Summarize following variables using appropriate graphs. Explain any patterns you observe.   

- admission year  
- admission month  
- admission month day  
- admission week day  
- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
- number of deaths in each year  
- admission type  
- number of admissions per patient  
- admission location  
- discharge location  
- insurance  
- language  
- martial status  
- ethnicity  
- death 

Note it is possible that one patient (uniquely identified by the `SUBJECT_ID`) is admitted into hospital multiple times. When summarizing some demographic information, it makes sense to summarize based on unique patients. 

## Q5. `patient` data

Explore `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/patients/>) and summarize following variables using appropriate numerics and graphs:  

- `gender`  
- `anchor_age` (explain pattern you see)

## Q6. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. 

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, hematocrit, white blood cell count, glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and lactate. Find the `itemid`s of these lab measurements from `d_labitems.csv.gz` and retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` only containing these items.

## Q7. Vitals from chartered events

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate, mean and systolic blood pressure (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined), body temperature, SpO2, and respiratory rate.

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patientâ€™s information is their electronic chart. The `ITEMID` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `VALUE` variable is the value measured for `ITEMID`. 

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `ITEMID` in `CHARTEVENTS.csv`. Find potential values of `ITEMID` that correspond to systolic blood pressure, i.e., `LABEL` contains the string `systolic`. 

## Q8. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble for all ICU stays, where rows are  

- first ICU stay of each unique patient  
- adults (age at admission > 18)  

and columns contains at least following variables  

- all variables in `icustays.csv.gz`  
- all variables in `admission.csv.gz`  
- first lab measurements during ICU stay  
- first vitals measurement during ICU stay  
- an indicator variable whether the patient died within 30 days of hospital admission
